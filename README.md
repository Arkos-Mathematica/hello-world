# hello-world
My first repository

Hello, I am relatively new to the coding scene (I have done a few programming camps and have taken an Intro to Python course), but I would like to expand my knowledge. I have interacted with both Python and Javascript in the past and hope to increase my knowledge of those languages whilst expanding my repetoire to include Java. I am interested in Privacy and Cyberfreedom projects, but am open to most projects that provide me with the oppurtunity to expand my knowledge.

Live long and Prosper.
